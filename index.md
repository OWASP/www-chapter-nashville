# Welcome to the OWASP Nashville Chapter!

# Want to speak at a future meeting?

We have a [CFP hosted by PaperCall.io](https://www.papercall.io/owasp-nashville). All talks are welcome that are germane to OWASP. We encourage Nashville community members, especially
anyone who wants to speak for the first time, to submit a talk.  We'll have plenty of space for seasoned engineers and well-practiced talks just as much as we will those who are less-experienced, college
students or want to be more involved or practice their public speaking.

# Next Meeting / Event

February 29th, 5:00 - 7:00 PM at [Asurion Headquarters](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?whereami=1&query=36.15925%2C-86.78715#map=18/36.15925/-86.78715)
Details on the title of the talk, speaker bio and more are being finalized but will be posted ASAP!
