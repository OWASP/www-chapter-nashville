# Next Meeting / Event

## 05/04/2021: Secure Coding Tournament with Secure Code Warrior

[https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Nashville-Chapter/events/277409499](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Nashville-Chapter/events/277409499)

Secure Code Warrior brings you a defensive security-based tournament from a developer's perspective. The tournament allows you to test your skill against the other participants in a series of vulnerable code challenges that ask you to identify a problem, locate insecure code, and fix a vulnerability. You donâ€™t need programming knowledge as this will be a great way to learn the foundations and intermediates of leveraging code that is not only functional but is also secure. With a variety of languages to play with: C# .NET MVC, C# .NET WebForms, C# .NET Core, GO Basic, Java EE (JSP) & (JSF), Java Spring, JavaScript Node.JS (Express), Python Django, and last but not least, Pseudocode Basic for the non-coders.
