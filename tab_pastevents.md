## 05/19/2020: Web Application Cyber Range for Fun & Profit

For our first virtual Meetup, Security Innovation ran one of their [CMD+CTRL Cyber Ranges](https://www.securityinnovation.com/training/cmd-ctrl-cyber-range-security-training/) in which our chapter competed:

> Stuck at home, but still want to test your skills in identifying web app vulnerabilities? OWASP Nashville and Security Innovation invite you to virtually compete in CMD+CTRL, a web application cyber range where players exploit their way through hundreds of vulnerabilities that lurk in business applications today. Success means learning quickly that attack and defense is all about thinking on your feet.

> For each vulnerability you uncover, you are awarded points. Climb the interactive leaderboard for a chance to win fantastic prizes! CMD+CTRL is ideal for development teams to train and develop skills, but anyone involved in keeping your organization’s data secure can play - from developers and managers and even CISOs.

> All you need is your laptop and your mischievous, curious inner-self and you’ll be ready to hack away!

## 10/22/2019: Serverless Security for Dummies

Tal Melamed ([@4ppsec](https://twitter.com/4ppsec)), Head of Security Research at [Protego Labs](http://protego.io/) and Co-Leader of the [OWASP Serverless Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-serverless-top-10/), flew in to teach us about Serverless Security:

> In moving to serverless technology, such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, we shift some security responsibilities to the infrastructure provider by eliminating the need to manage servers. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean we’re entirely absolved of all security duties. Serverless functions still execute code and can still be vulnerable to application-level attacks. As a new type of architecture, serverless presents new security challenges. Some are equal to traditional application development, but some take a new form. Attackers are thinking differently, and developers must do so as well to gain the upper hand.

> In this talk, Tal Melamed will dive into serverless risks. Discussing why they are different from traditional attacks, how to exploit them and how we should protect our application against them.
