## 11/10/2021: AWS ID Prefixes: What AWS Doesn't Cover is What You Need to Know

[![AWS ID Prefixes: What AWS Doesn't Cover is What You Need to Know](https://img.youtube.com/vi/V2izKdOb1hM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2izKdOb1hM "AWS ID Prefixes: What AWS Doesn't Cover is What You Need to Know")

[https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Nashville-Chapter/events/281949599/](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Nashville-Chapter/events/281949599/)

In this talk, we will showcase AWS Prefixes and go over those prefixes what they mean, how you can get them. Some resource types like S3 for example allow for the use of a unique ID rather than the full principal ARN that many know and understand. We can cover why use of the unique ID is fundamentally a bad idea, and how to handle them should you run into an environment that has them.

## 05/04/2021: Secure Coding Tournament with Secure Code Warrior

Secure Code Warrior brings you a defensive security-based tournament from a developer's perspective. The tournament allows you to test your skill against the other participants in a series of vulnerable code challenges that ask you to identify a problem, locate insecure code, and fix a vulnerability. You don’t need programming knowledge as this will be a great way to learn the foundations and intermediates of leveraging code that is not only functional but is also secure. With a variety of languages to play with: C# .NET MVC, C# .NET WebForms, C# .NET Core, GO Basic, Java EE (JSP) & (JSF), Java Spring, JavaScript Node.JS (Express), Python Django, and last but not least, Pseudocode Basic for the non-coders.

## 03/02/2021: OWASP Threat and Safeguard Matrix (TaSM)

[![OWASP Threat and Safeguard Matrix (TaSM)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/GRpU9L--qSg/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRpU9L--qSg "OWASP Threat and Safeguard Matrix (TaSM)")

[The Threat and Safeguard Matrix or (TaSM)](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-and-safeguard-matrix/) is an action oriented view to safeguard and enable the business created by [Ross Young](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrrossyoung/). Simply put if Cyber is in the business of Revenue Protection, then we need to have a defense in depth plan to combat the biggest threats to our companies. This matrix allows a company to overlay their major threats with the NIST Cyber Security Functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, & Recover) to build a robust security plan. Organizations which perform this activity will gain a better understanding of how to protect their company as they fill in safeguards which mitigate important threats. Remember the devil is in the details, hence why we chose a TaSManian Devil as the project logo.

Ross Young is the CISO of Caterpillar Financial, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University, and a SANS instructor.  Prior to this role, he was a divisional CISO at Capital One.  His expertise ranges from attacking financial services for the federal government to defending organizations by automating defenses in DevSecOps pipelines. He is actively involved in all things cloud, container, and Kubernetes security.  Ross holds master's and bachelor's degrees from Johns Hopkins University, Idaho State University, and Utah State University. Ross's interest in pirates and ninjas have inspired him to stealthily enable and safeguard the business without the paperwork.

## 10/27/2020: Defending Multicloud Infrastructure

Senior Application Security Engineer at Asurion, Instructor for the SANS Institute, and OWASP Nashville Co-Leader Brandon Evans discussed how to defend infrastructure and applications running in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Brandon is the lead author of SANS SEC510: Multicloud Security Assessment and Defense. For more information, visit: [SANS.org/SEC510](http://sans.org/SEC510)

## 05/19/2020: Web Application Cyber Range for Fun & Profit

For our first virtual Meetup, Security Innovation ran one of their [CMD+CTRL Cyber Ranges](https://www.securityinnovation.com/training/cmd-ctrl-cyber-range-security-training/) in which our chapter competed:

> Stuck at home, but still want to test your skills in identifying web app vulnerabilities? OWASP Nashville and Security Innovation invite you to virtually compete in CMD+CTRL, a web application cyber range where players exploit their way through hundreds of vulnerabilities that lurk in business applications today. Success means learning quickly that attack and defense is all about thinking on your feet.

> For each vulnerability you uncover, you are awarded points. Climb the interactive leaderboard for a chance to win fantastic prizes! CMD+CTRL is ideal for development teams to train and develop skills, but anyone involved in keeping your organization’s data secure can play - from developers and managers and even CISOs.

> All you need is your laptop and your mischievous, curious inner-self and you’ll be ready to hack away!

## 10/22/2019: Serverless Security for Dummies

Tal Melamed ([@4ppsec](https://twitter.com/4ppsec)), Head of Security Research at [Protego Labs](http://protego.io/) and Co-Leader of the [OWASP Serverless Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-serverless-top-10/), flew in to teach us about Serverless Security:

> In moving to serverless technology, such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, we shift some security responsibilities to the infrastructure provider by eliminating the need to manage servers. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean we’re entirely absolved of all security duties. Serverless functions still execute code and can still be vulnerable to application-level attacks. As a new type of architecture, serverless presents new security challenges. Some are equal to traditional application development, but some take a new form. Attackers are thinking differently, and developers must do so as well to gain the upper hand.

> In this talk, Tal Melamed will dive into serverless risks. Discussing why they are different from traditional attacks, how to exploit them and how we should protect our application against them.
